                                    easily customizable to the customerâ€™s needs to suit any business.</p>

                                    does it mean that all the data is lost?</h3>
                                <p>A: Once implementation is done for eZYFinance, a backup system is also installed 
                                    and the backup of the whole database is done on a separate hard drive meaning 
                                    the downtime is minimized in case of any disaster since the restoration of the database can be done within minutes. </p>

                                <p>A: The administrator can view all the transactions done at the weighbridge and print the tickets. With the tickets, 
                                    the administrator will know who carried which transaction, when, the destination and source of the vehicle, 
                                    vehicle registration number, weight of the vehicle e.t.c</p>

                                <p>A: Before saving any transaction the system accesses weight consistency of the vehicle at the weighbridge.</p>

                                <p>A: Security is key. Only the administrator has access to all the modules in the systems and 
                                    is one who assigns permission to other users of the system. For anyone to use the system, they must have 
                                    a User Name and Password without which access to the system is impossible.
                                    Even with a User Name and Password, one can only access the modules for which he/she is authorized.</p>
